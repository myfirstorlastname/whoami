  <h2>🧠 About</h2>
  <p>This page summarizes my work on the <a href="https://tryhackme.com/module/network-security" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Network Security</a> module from TryHackMe’s Jr Penetration Tester path. It introduces fundamental network concepts and offensive tactics used to discover and analyze network services.</p>
  <p>Though I have real-world experience with network enumeration, this module offered a structured recap that aligns well with early red team training and OSCP prep.</p>

  <h2>🛰️ Philosophy</h2>
  <blockquote>"Enumeration is half the battle."</blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>I treat network layers as puzzles: scan, observe, deduce.
      <ul>
        <li>Focus on behavior over banners—how do services respond to edge cases?</li>
        <li>Every port has a reason. Understand the service before trying to break it.</li>
        <li>Go wide (discovery) before going deep (exploitation).</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>🔎 Learning Outcomes: Network Security</h2>
  <blockquote>Understand how attackers scan and map networks to find vulnerabilities.</blockquote>

  <h3>📘 Module Summary</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Basics of TCP/IP, ports, and protocols</li>
    <li>ICMP, TCP, UDP scanning techniques</li>
    <li>Tooling:
      <ul>
        <li><code>nmap</code> — discover hosts, ports, versions, and OS</li>
        <li><code>netcat</code> — banner grabbing and manual connections</li>
        <li><code>Wireshark</code> — protocol analysis (introduction)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Scanning lab: identify open ports, infer OS, fingerprint services</li>
    <li>Firewall and IDS concepts (briefly covered)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>🧪 What I appreciated as an advanced learner</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Good coverage of the difference between TCP connect vs SYN scan</li>
    <li>Hands-on challenge involving timing, port state, and service inference</li>
    <li>Reinforces discipline: never assume results without validation</li>
    <li>The module encourages testing hypotheses using different flags and scanning techniques</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>🎓 Who I recommend this to</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Anyone starting in offensive security, before diving into exploitation</li>
    <li>Blue teamers who want to understand how attackers see their network</li>
    <li>Students aiming to build a solid mental model of services and exposure</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>🛠️ My Personal Tips</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Use <code>-sV</code>, <code>-sC</code>, <code>-O</code> in <code>nmap</code> only when needed. Avoid noise on real targets.</li>
    <li>Learn to read <code>nmap</code> output critically—know what's accurate, what's guessed.</li>
    <li>Don’t overlook UDP—it’s noisy and slow, but often ignored by defenders too.</li>
    <li>Always verify findings manually. Banners lie.</li>
    <li>Use versioned scans to trigger defensive systems in a lab and watch how they behave.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>✅ Completion Status</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Module completed: 100%</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Final thoughts:</strong> This module is foundational. It teaches the observation mindset essential for both Red and Blue teams. Master this before moving to privilege escalation or lateral movement.</li>
  </ul>
