  <h2>üß† About</h2>
  <p>
    Access control is one of the simplest yet most important aspects of web security.  
    It refers to the rules and mechanisms that define <strong>who can access which resources</strong>, and what actions they are allowed to perform.  
    When broken, it allows attackers to impersonate other users, steal sensitive data, or even escalate their privileges to an administrator account.
  </p>
  <p>
    Because access control flaws are easy to introduce and often overlooked by developers, they consistently appear in the 
    <a href="https://owasp.org/Top10/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OWASP Top 10</a>.  
    This course provides a beginner-friendly introduction, reinforced by examples from 
    <a href="https://portswigger.net/web-security/access-control" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PortSwigger Labs</a>.

  <h2>üìò What is Access Control?</h2>
  <p>
    Access control ensures that a user can only access the resources that belong to them.  
    It usually involves two dimensions:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Horizontal Access Control</strong> : Preventing users from accessing resources belonging to other users (e.g., Alice cannot view Bob‚Äôs profile).</li>
    <li><strong>Vertical Access Control</strong> : Preventing users from performing actions reserved for higher-privileged roles (e.g., a normal user cannot access admin functionality).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Without strict enforcement, attackers can manipulate parameters, URLs, or workflows to break these controls.
  </p>

  <h2>üîé Examples from PortSwigger Labs</h2>

  <h3>1. Unprotected Admin Functionality</h3>
  <p>
    An admin panel is available at <code>/admin</code> but not protected by any authentication.  
    Simply visiting the page gives attackers full administrative rights.
  </p>

  <h3>2. User ID Controlled by Request Parameter</h3>
  <p>
    A request like <code>/profile?user=123</code> allows a logged-in user to change the ID and view another user‚Äôs account.  
    This is a classic case of <strong>IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference)</strong>.
  </p>

  <h3>3. User Role Controlled by Request Parameter</h3>
  <p>
    A hidden parameter <code>role=user</code> in requests can be changed to <code>role=admin</code>, granting unauthorized access.  
    This highlights the danger of trusting client-side input for authorization decisions.
  </p>

  <h3>4. Method- or URL-based Access Control</h3>
  <p>
    Some apps only restrict actions on certain HTTP methods (e.g., GET) or paths.  
    Switching to <code>POST</code> or accessing an alternative URL may bypass these protections.
  </p>

  <h2>üéØ How to Prevent Access Control Flaws</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Enforce <strong>authorization checks on the server side</strong> for every request.</li>
    <li>Use a <strong>deny-by-default</strong> approach: explicitly allow what‚Äôs permitted, block everything else.</li>
    <li>Apply the <strong>Principle of Least Privilege</strong> (users should only have the permissions they need).</li>
    <li>Do not rely on <strong>security by obscurity</strong> (hidden URLs, parameters, or Referer headers).</li>
    <li>Log access violations and monitor for suspicious activity.</li>
  </ul>
  <hr>

  <h2>‚úÖ Key Takeaways</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Access control flaws are often <strong>easy to find and exploit</strong>, yet devastating if left unchecked.</li>
    <li>They are among the <strong>most common real-world vulnerabilities</strong> reported in bug bounty and penetration tests.</li>
    <li>Even simple protections like requiring authentication and validating user IDs properly can stop entire classes of attacks.</li>
  </ul>

    <p>
      Access control is not about complex payloads or exotic exploits : it‚Äôs about discipline.  
      By rigorously enforcing rules on <strong>who can access what</strong>, developers can prevent attackers from moving horizontally across accounts or vertically into admin functions.  
      For beginners, mastering access control is one of the fastest ways to understand the essence of web application security.
