  <h2>Network Infrastructure vs Cloud Infrastructure</h2>
  <p>
    Before diving into cloud concepts, it's important to distinguish between <strong>network infrastructure</strong> and <strong>cloud infrastructure</strong>. While both are foundational, they serve different purposes and operate at different levels.
  </p>

  <h3>Network Infrastructure</h3>
  <p>
    This refers to the hardware and software components that enable communication between devices. It includes:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Routers, switches, firewalls</li>
    <li>Local networks (LAN), VLANs, VPNs</li>
    <li>Routing tables, NAT, DNS, DMZ zones</li>
    <li>Traffic inspection and segmentation</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Network infrastructure is usually physical or virtualized on-premise, and is managed by system/network administrators.
  </p>

  <h3>Cloud Infrastructure</h3>
  <p>
    Cloud infrastructure builds on top of networking and adds abstraction layers to offer services through virtualized environments:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Virtual networks (VPC, VNet) created on demand</li>
    <li>Compute resources (VMs, containers) provisioned instantly</li>
    <li>Storage buckets and databases available via API</li>
    <li>IAM controls, resource tagging, and automation pipelines</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Unlike traditional infrastructure, cloud infrastructure is elastic, abstracted, and integrated with security and management tools by design.
  </p>

  <h3>Key Differences</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Control:</strong> On-prem networks give full control. Cloud is managed through provider APIs.</li>
    <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Network infra is hardware-bound. Cloud infra scales elastically.</li>
    <li><strong>Responsibility:</strong> On-prem = full responsibility. Cloud = shared responsibility.</li>
    <li><strong>Visibility:</strong> Network tools (Wireshark, SNMP) vs Cloud logs & dashboards (CloudTrail, Azure Monitor)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Cloud doesn't replace network infrastructure — it builds upon it with agility, scalability, and new security paradigms.
  </p>

    <h2>What is Cloud Infrastructure?</h2>
    <p>
      Cloud infrastructure is the combination of hardware, virtualization, networking, and storage that powers cloud computing. Major cloud providers (like AWS, Azure, and GCP) offer virtualized access to this infrastructure on-demand.
    </p>
    <p>
      According to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/what-is-cloud-computing/" target="_blank">AWS</a>: <em>"Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the Internet with pay-as-you-go pricing."</em>
    </p>
    <p>Cloud infrastructure includes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Compute</strong>: Virtual Machines, containers, auto-scaling groups</li>
      <li><strong>Storage</strong>: Object storage (e.g., S3), block storage, archival services</li>
      <li><strong>Networking</strong>: Virtual networks (VPCs), subnets, gateways, firewalls</li>
      <li><strong>Security Services</strong>: IAM, logging, monitoring, key management</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>The Shared Responsibility Model</h2>
    <p>
      Security in the cloud is based on a shared model. The provider handles the security "of" the cloud, while the customer is responsible for the security "in" the cloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Provider responsibilities:</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Physical data centers</li>
      <li>Network hardware</li>
      <li>Hypervisors and base infrastructure</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>Customer responsibilities:</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Operating systems, applications, data</li>
      <li>Access control & user management (IAM)</li>
      <li>Security configurations, network segmentation</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This model varies slightly between IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS services.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>From On-Premise to Hybrid Environments</h2>
    <p>
      Many organizations operate in hybrid environments: part of the infrastructure remains on-premise (legacy servers, internal apps), while the rest migrates to the cloud.
    </p>
    <p>This introduces new challenges:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Log collection across distributed systems</li>
      <li>Unifying access control and audit mechanisms</li>
      <li>Detecting lateral movement between environments</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Security teams must bridge the visibility gap between traditional perimeter-based security and cloud-native controls.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Cloud Threat Surfaces</h2>
    <p>New services bring new risks. Common attack vectors in cloud environments include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Misconfigurations</strong> – Public S3 buckets, overly permissive IAM roles</li>
      <li><strong>Credential leakage</strong> – Exposed API keys, secrets in code repositories</li>
      <li><strong>Unmonitored services</strong> – Unused but accessible endpoints</li>
      <li><strong>Privilege escalation</strong> – Abuse of trust relationships or role chaining</li>
      <li><strong>Insecure APIs</strong> – Lack of authentication or input validation</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Defensive teams should focus on minimizing the attack surface through hardening, monitoring, and least privilege.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Blue Team Monitoring Capabilities</h2>
    <p>Cloud platforms offer native logging and detection tools. Understanding and enabling them is key to effective monitoring:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Identity & Access Logs</strong> – Who accessed what, and how?</li>
      <li><strong>Audit Trails</strong> – Resource changes, login events, API calls</li>
      <li><strong>Network Flow Logs</strong> – Detect suspicious traffic patterns</li>
      <li><strong>Alerts and Rules</strong> – Triggered on anomalous activity (e.g., login from new country)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Tools like AWS CloudTrail, Azure Monitor, and GCP Cloud Audit Logs are native ways to gain observability.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Core Concepts to Master</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Virtual networking: subnets, routing tables, gateways</li>
      <li>Access control: IAM roles, policies, trust relationships</li>
      <li>Storage security: encryption, lifecycle, access permissions</li>
      <li>Service hardening: disabling defaults, monitoring config drift</li>
      <li>Cloud incident response: log correlation, role misuse detection</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These concepts form the foundation of both proactive defense and incident response in the cloud.

    The cloud reshapes the perimeter, but not the responsibility. Know your architecture, monitor your assets, and defend every layer.
