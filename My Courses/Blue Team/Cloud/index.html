    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Cloud Computing</strong> refers to the on-demand delivery of computing resources, servers, databases, storage, networks, over the Internet. It relies on providers like <em>Azure</em>, <em>AWS</em>, or <em>Google Cloud</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The term <strong>infrastructure</strong> includes all physical and virtual components (servers, networks, firewalls, VMs, etc.) required to run cloud and on-prem services. It forms the technical backbone of any organization.

    <h2>The Role of SOC Level 4</h2>
    <p>
      In a SOC (Security Operations Center) context, a Level 4 analyst (<strong>SOC N4</strong>) is typically involved in:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Incident response across <strong>hybrid</strong> environments (cloud/on-prem).</li>
      <li>Monitoring cloud <strong>configuration, logging</strong>, and IAM policies.</li>
      <li>Investigating compromises on platforms like <strong>Azure AD</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      A solid understanding of both infrastructure and cloud architecture is essential to detect, correlate, and respond effectively to threats in distributed environments.

    The cloud reshapes the perimeter, but not the responsibility. Know your architecture, monitor your assets, and defend every layer.
