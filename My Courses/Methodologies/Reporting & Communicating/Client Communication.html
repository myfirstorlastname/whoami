    <h1>Client Communication : Pentest Consultant</h1>
    <blockquote>Good hacks are invisible. Good reports make them unforgettable.</blockquote>
  </header>

  <h2>Goal: Be Understood by Non-Technical Stakeholders</h2>
  <p>
    As a pentest consultant, you often need to present technical findings to business executives or clients who may not have a technical background.
    Your mission is to:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Avoid technical jargon</li>
    <li>Communicate business risks clearly</li>
    <li>Offer actionable and understandable recommendations</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Translate Technical Findings into Business Impact</h2>
  <p>Instead of saying:</p>
  <blockquote>
    “Your Tomcat server is vulnerable to CVE-2021-44228 on port 8080.”
  </blockquote>
  <p>Say:</p>
  <blockquote>
    “We found a flaw on a public server that could allow attackers to take full control. This vulnerability has been used in real-world attacks by cybercriminals.”
  </blockquote>

  <p>Instead of “LFI (Local File Inclusion)”:</p>
  <blockquote>
    “An attacker could read sensitive files on your server, such as passwords or internal configuration, without needing to log in.”
  </blockquote>

  <h2>Build a Clear, Impactful Message</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Finding:</strong> “We simulated an external attacker and accessed...”</li>
    <li><strong>Risk:</strong> “This gives access to sensitive client data.”</li>
    <li><strong>Likelihood:</strong> “This is a well-known vulnerability actively exploited.”</li>
    <li><strong>Recommendation:</strong> “We strongly recommend applying this fix within 7 days.”</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Clear Wording Examples</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Technical:</strong> “Reflected XSS on GET parameter ‘search’.”</li>
    <li><strong>Business-oriented:</strong> “An attacker could trick users into running malicious code in their browser via your website.”</li>
  </ul>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Technical:</strong> “No rate limiting on login form.”</li>
    <li><strong>Business-oriented:</strong> “An attacker could try thousands of passwords in minutes without being blocked.”</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>General Tips for Executive Briefings</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Focus on what <strong>could happen</strong>, not what you “hacked”</li>
    <li>Use analogies: “This is like leaving a backdoor unlocked”</li>
    <li>Provide <strong>prioritized, realistic actions</strong></li>
    <li>Show that you <strong>understand their business context</strong></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Sample Verbal Summary</h2>
  <blockquote>
    “In summary, we identified 3 critical issues: public access to a sensitive server, weak authentication controls, and lack of logging. These haven’t been exploited yet, but they expose your business to real threats. We suggest addressing the top 2 risks immediately.”
