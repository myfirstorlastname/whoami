    <h2>ðŸ§­ Why It Matters in Cybersecurity</h2>
    <p>
      Whether you're reporting a critical vulnerability or documenting a suspicious login attempt, your words shape decisions. Clear communication:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Influences how risks are perceived and prioritized by stakeholders</li>
      <li>Accelerates triage and remediation by other teams</li>
      <li>Serves as audit trails and evidence in compliance or incident response</li>
      <li>Bridges the gap between technical insight and business impact</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Being technically sharp is important but being understood is often more impactful.
