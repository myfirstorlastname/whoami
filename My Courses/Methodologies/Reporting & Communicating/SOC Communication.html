    <h1>Communication in SOC Level 1</h1>
    <blockquote>Good hacks are invisible. Good reports make them unforgettable.</blockquote>
  </header>

  <h2>1. Why Communication Is Crucial in a SOC</h2>
  <p>
    In a Security Operations Center (SOC), communication is a fundamental pillar to ensure operational continuity, proper incident handling, and effective collaboration between analysts.
  </p>
  <p>
    A Level 1 (L1) analyst, though junior in the technical hierarchy, is often the first responder to an alert. They must:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Quickly understand the context of an alert</li>
    <li>Document it clearly and actionably</li>
    <li>Efficiently relay it to the team, the next shift, or upper levels</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. Day-to-Day Operational Communication</h2>
  <p>Here are the main forms of communication expected daily in a SOC:</p>

  <h3>Tickets & ITSM Tools</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Common tools:</strong> ServiceNow, Jira, GLPI, TheHive, etc.</li>
    <li><strong>Best practices:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Clear title: <code>[SIEM] Possible Brute-force on OWA</code></li>
        <li>Timestamp all key events (UTC + local)</li>
        <li>Concise yet complete description: source, detection method, alert type</li>
        <li>Attach evidence: logs, screenshots, alert ID</li>
        <li>Document actions taken: lookups, whois, enrichment</li>
        <li>Propose severity level and escalation if needed</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Shift Handover & Internal Communication</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Daily briefings or handover meetings: current incidents, escalations</li>
    <li>Document ongoing alerts with clear status: <code>under analysis</code>, <code>waiting for N2 response</code>, etc.</li>
    <li>Use instant channels like Slack, Mattermost, or MS Teams</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Escalation to L2/L3</h3>
  <p>When an incident is beyond L1's scope, it must be escalated clearly. A good escalation includes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Summary: <em>“SSH brute-force attempt from persistent suspicious IP despite blocking.”</em></li>
    <li>Evidence: logs, screenshots, SIEM details, alert ID</li>
    <li>Context: frequency, repetition, potential impact</li>
    <li>Expectations: confirmation, action from L2/L3, firewall block, etc.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Professional Written Communication</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Use a simple, clear, neutral tone (avoid judgment)</li>
    <li>Favor short sentences: subject + verb + object</li>
    <li>Structure visually: bullet points, paragraphs, spacing</li>
    <li>Use standard acronyms (IOC, IP, SIEM, MITRE, etc.)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Verbal Communication</h2>
  <p>
    As an L1 analyst, you will also be involved in verbal interactions such as:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Team briefings (stand-up meetings)</li>
    <li>Incident debriefs or post-mortems</li>
    <li>Occasionally, presenting findings to a security manager</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Your tone should be calm, precise, and factual. You should be able to explain a technical alert in simple, accurate terms.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Example: L1 Incident Ticket</h2>
  <pre><code>
[Title] : [SIEM] SSH Brute-force on Bastion - Russian IP

[Timestamp] : 2025-07-15 09:42 UTC

[Source] : Alert triggered by Splunk (use-case: bruteforce_ssh)

[Description] :
Over 80 SSH login attempts within 10 minutes on the admin bastion (internal IP: 10.10.0.1).
Source IP: 185.202.X.X (ASN OVH - RU)

[Evidence] : Splunk logs, correlation screenshot, VirusTotal lookup (suspicious)

[Actions Taken by L1] :
- Identified IP as malicious
- No successful login
- No other alerts on that host

[Escalation] : Suggested temporary firewall block
  </code></pre>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    Being a good SOC Level 1 analyst goes beyond understanding alerts. It's about relaying them clearly, without distortion, to teammates or higher levels. Strong communication helps anticipate risks, avoid mistakes, and streamline incident response workflows.
