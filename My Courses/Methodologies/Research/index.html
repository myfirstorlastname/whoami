    <h2>What is cybersecurity research?</h2>
    <p>
      In cybersecurity, research is not just academic — it's a daily skill. It includes everything from staying updated on vulnerabilities, to investigating new technologies, to crafting tailored exploits in real-world scenarios. This section explores different angles of research used by offensive and defensive professionals alike.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a pentester, SOC analyst, or Red Team operator, being able to <strong>quickly gather, validate, and apply technical intelligence</strong> is critical to success.
