  <h2>🧠 About</h2>
  <p>This page summarizes my review of the <strong>Metasploit</strong> module from the TryHackMe Jr Penetration Tester path. While I'm already familiar with the Metasploit framework, this module served as a refresh and opportunity to reinforce methodology.</p>
  <p>Metasploit is often criticized as a script kiddie tool—but used well, it’s an extremely powerful exploitation and post-exploitation framework. This module teaches it right: as part of a workflow, not a shortcut.</p>

  <h2>🛰️ Philosophy</h2>
  <blockquote>"Tools don’t hack—operators do."</blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>I believe automation should enhance, not replace, understanding.</li>
    <li>I use Metasploit with full awareness of what’s happening under the hood.</li>
    <li>I often replicate exploit steps manually first, then automate with Metasploit for scale or post-exploitation.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>🧪 What the Module Covers</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Metasploit architecture and modules (auxiliary, exploit, payload, post)</li>
    <li>Searching for and selecting modules via <code>search</code></li>
    <li>Setting payloads and options with <code>set</code> and <code>show</code></li>
    <li>Running exploits and receiving sessions</li>
    <li>Post-exploitation basics: enum, pivoting, persistence</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>🧠 Highlights</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>The module uses Metasploit responsibly: one tool among many in your workflow.</li>
    <li>It shows how to enumerate services and pick exploits thoughtfully.</li>
    <li>It builds toward more advanced practices like generating persistent payloads and interacting with Meterpreter sessions.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>🎯 Who Should Study This</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Pentesters new to Metasploit who want to avoid “click and pray.”</li>
    <li>Anyone preparing for OSCP or trying to bridge the gap between theory and practice.</li>
    <li>CTF players who want to understand the framework they’ve seen in walkthroughs.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>🛠️ Pro Tips</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Always run <code>info</code> on a module before using it—it explains the exploit's logic.</li>
    <li>Use <code>sessions -i</code> to manage shells, especially with multiple targets.</li>
    <li>Consider using <code>msfvenom</code> to generate payloads outside of the console.</li>
    <li>When Metasploit fails, redo the attack manually. That’s how you learn.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>✅ Completion Status</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Module completed: 100%</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Final thoughts:</strong> This is more than a tool tutorial—it’s a gentle introduction to frameworks, sessions, and real-world automation. A must before diving into complex post-exploitation.</li>
