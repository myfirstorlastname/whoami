  <h2>üß† About</h2>
  <p>I'm a pseudonymous cybersecurity professional with expertise in offensive security, SOC analysis, and secure system design.<br />
     OSCP (Offensive Security Certified Professional) is a hands-on certification by OffSec that validates expertise in offensive testing.</br>
     This page outlines my self-driven journey toward becoming an Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP). It showcases the progression of my Active Directory offensive technical skills‚Äîfrom basic knowledge to Pentester. This page is designed for recruiters and cybersecurity professionals who want a clear picture of my dedication and capabilities.<br />

  <h2>üõ∞Ô∏è Philosophy</h2>
  <blockquote>"Slow and steady wins the prize."</blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>I believe offensive security is not about being the smartest person in the room‚Äîit‚Äôs about practice, deep comprehension of infrastructures, and method. I treat working as an AD Pentester as a craft: Initial Access, Enumeration, Adaptability, Repeat. My learning philosophy includes:
      <ul>
        <li>Try ‚Üí Fail ‚Üí Learn: I embrace discomfort as a sign of growth.</li>
        <li>Consistency over bursts: A few focused hours every day beats weekend marathons.</li>
        <li>Depth over tools: I master concepts, not just tools.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>üõ†Ô∏è Roadmap to basic Pentest tools</h2>
  <blockquote>From basic knowledge to Meterpreter</blockquote>
  <h3>Active Directory</h3>
  <p>Windows is the most common used OS in the world, it's also the OS mostly used in Active Directories.</p>
  <p>90% of entreprises have an Active Directory, it's almost as widespread as websites.</p>
  <p>Those two subjects represent almost 100% of pentesters' missions.</p>
  <p>I began my journey into offensive cybersecurity with a fundamental question: How can I transition into a professional offensive security role?</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The answer is to gain experience on these two subjects.</li>
    <li>At this time period, I already mastered web-offensive security basics.</li>
    <li>My last step towards OSCP is Active Directory offensive security.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>A directory is a hierarchical structure that stores information about objects on a network. A directory service, such as <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/get-started/virtual-dc/active-directory-domain-services-overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)</a>, provides the methods for storing directory data and making this data available to network users and administrators. For example, AD DS stores information about user accounts, such as names, passwords, phone numbers, and so on. AD DS also provides a way for authorized users on the same network to access this information.</p>

  <h3><a href="https://tryhackme.com/module/hacking-windows-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Windows Exploitation Basics</a></h3>
  <p>Hacking Windows is often daunting. Grasp the fundamentals of core Windows concepts and Active Directory vulnerabilities.</p>
  <p>Windows is the most popular operating system, used by both individuals and within corporate environments. Windows systems are often linked together to create networks, which are used in most enterprises around the world. This module will explore everything from getting started with using Windows, to attacking common flaws that are found in common Windows systems.</p>
  <h4><a href="https://tryhackme.com/room/windowsfundamentals1xbx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Windows Fundamentals 1</a></h4>
  <p>In part 1 of the Windows Fundamentals module, we'll start our journey learning about the Windows desktop, the NTFS file system, UAC, the Control Panel, and more.</p>
  <h4><a href="https://tryhackme.com/room/windowsfundamentals2x0x" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Windows Fundamentals 2</a></h4>
  <p>In part 2 of the Windows Fundamentals module, discover more about System Configuration, UAC Settings, Resource Monitoring, the Windows Registry and more.</p>
  <h4><a href="https://tryhackme.com/room/winadbasics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Active Directory Basics</a></h4>
  <p>Microsoft's Active Directory is the backbone of the corporate world. It simplifies the management of devices and users within a corporate environment. In this room, we'll take a deep dive into the essential components of Active Directory.</p>
  <h4><a href="https://tryhackme.com/room/metasploitintro" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Metasploit: Introduction</a></h4>
  <p>Metasploit is the most widely used exploitation framework. Metasploit is a powerful tool that can support all phases of a penetration testing engagement, from information gathering to post-exploitation.</p>
  <h4><a href="https://tryhackme.com/room/metasploitexploitation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Metasploit: Exploitation</a></h4>
  <p>In this room, we will learn how to use Metasploit for vulnerability scanning and exploitation. We will also cover how the database feature makes it easier to manage penetration testing engagements with a broader scope. Finally, we will look at generating payloads with msfvenom and how to start a Meterpreter session on most target platforms.</p>
  <h4><a href="https://tryhackme.com/room/meterpreter" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Metasploit: Meterpreter</a></h4>
  <p>Meterpreter is a Metasploit payload that supports the penetration testing process with many valuable components. Meterpreter will run on the target system and act as an agent within a command and control architecture. You will interact with the target operating system and files and use Meterpreter's specialized commands.</p>
