  <h2>🧠 About</h2>
  <p>I'm a pseudonymous cybersecurity professional with expertise in offensive security, SOC analysis, and secure system design.<br />
     This page summarizes my experience with TryHackMe's <a href="https://tryhackme.com/module/introduction-to-web-hacking" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"Introduction to Web Hacking"</a> module, which is part of the <em>Jr Penetration Tester</em> path. Though I’m beyond the junior level, I completed this module as a structured review and found it to be a very well-crafted learning tool. I recommend it to students and aspiring penetration testers looking for a strong introduction to web vulnerabilities.<br />

  <h2>🔎 Learning Outcomes: Introduction to Web Hacking</h2>
  <blockquote>A beginner-friendly yet technically sound introduction to real-world web exploitation</blockquote>

  <h3>📘 Module Summary</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>This module covers the foundational concepts of web exploitation, including:
      <ul>
        <li>Understanding how web servers and clients interact</li>
        <li>Basic enumeration techniques using browser and CLI tools</li>
        <li>Finding and exploiting common vulnerabilities such as:
          <ul>
            <li>Directory traversal</li>
            <li>Command injection</li>
            <li>File upload abuse</li>
            <li>Authentication bypass</li>
            <li>Basic SQL injection</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Using Burp Suite for interception and manipulation</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>While basic, it reinforces key methodology: information gathering → manual testing → exploitation → post-exploitation.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>🧪 What I appreciated as an advanced learner</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Well-paced delivery of concepts, each room builds upon the last.</li>
    <li>The labs are not overly guided: the user is expected to think and test hypotheses.</li>
    <li>Encourages minimal tool dependency. Many tasks can be solved with <code>curl</code>, browser, or basic scripting.</li>
    <li>Common developer mistakes are highlighted with practical examples.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>🎓 Who I recommend this to</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>University students starting cybersecurity and looking for hands-on challenges.</li>
    <li>Developers aiming to understand how their applications can be misused.</li>
    <li>Anyone pursuing OSCP, as it teaches a precise and methodical approach that matches exam expectations.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>🛠️ My Personal Tips</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Don't rush. Take time to test every user input field even GET parameters.</li>
    <li>Burp Suite's Repeater is your best friend: replay and modify requests systematically.</li>
    <li>When exploiting uploads, always check for file extensions and bypass techniques (e.g., <code>file.php.jpg</code>).</li>
    <li>Always analyze server responses: a 403 or 500 error is a clue, not a blocker.</li>
    <li>Use <code>curl -I</code> or <code>curl -v</code> to view HTTP headers and spot potential weaknesses.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>✅ Completion Status</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Module completed: 100%</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Final thoughts:</strong> This is the perfect gateway to more advanced modules like <em>OWASP Top 10</em> or <em>Web Pentesting</em>. A solid warm-up before tackling real CTFs or OSCP-level machines.</li>
  </ul>
