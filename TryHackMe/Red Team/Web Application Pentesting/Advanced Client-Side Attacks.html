  <h2>🧠 About</h2>
  <p>
    This page documents my completion of the 
    <a href="https://tryhackme.com/module/advanced-client-side-attacks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"Advanced Client-Side Attacks"</a> 
    module, part of the <em>Web Application Pentesting</em> learning path on TryHackMe.  
    Unlike server-side flaws, client-side vulnerabilities exploit the trust users place in their browsers and the way web applications process untrusted data.
  </p>
  <p>
    The module explores how seemingly harmless front-end interactions can be abused to hijack sessions, steal data, bypass policies, and even pivot deeper into applications.  
    The emphasis is on chaining small weaknesses into impactful client-side compromise.

  <h2>🛰️ Philosophy</h2>
  <blockquote>"The client is the attacker’s playground—the DOM, the policies, and the scripts are all fair game."</blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>Client-side flaws are often underestimated, yet they are entry points to account takeover, phishing, and supply-chain compromise.</li>
    <li>The browser is not a fortress—it executes whatever code it is fed, and security depends on fragile policies.</li>
    <li>Pentesters must treat every client-side behavior as potentially exploitable: what the user sees, the attacker can twist.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>🔎 Learning Outcomes: Advanced Client-Side Attacks</h2>
  <blockquote>From reflected XSS to CORS misconfigurations—understanding how the browser becomes an attacker’s ally.</blockquote>

  <h3>📘 Module Summary</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)</strong>  
      Covered reflected, stored, and DOM-based XSS. Demonstrated how injecting scripts into a vulnerable context allows session hijacking, credential theft, or phishing. Practical exploitation involved payload crafting and bypassing filters.</li>
    <li><strong>Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)</strong>  
      Showed how attackers can trick authenticated users into performing unintended actions. Exercises emphasized anti-CSRF tokens, SameSite cookies, and why missing controls can lead to full account compromise.</li>
    <li><strong>DOM-Based Attacks</strong>  
      Focused on vulnerabilities within client-side JavaScript logic, including dangerous sinks like <code>innerHTML</code>, <code>document.write()</code>, and <code>eval()</code>. Highlighted the risks of trusting <code>location.hash</code> or <code>document.URL</code> without sanitization.</li>
    <li><strong>CORS & SOP</strong>  
      Explored how weak or misconfigured Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) and Same-Origin Policy (SOP) rules allow attackers to read sensitive data from other domains. Demonstrated bypass scenarios with wildcards and misaligned origins.</li>
    <li><strong>"What's Your Name" (Challenge)</strong>  
      A final, realistic scenario chaining multiple client-side issues. Required spotting subtle DOM vulnerabilities and leveraging them with crafted payloads to achieve a successful exploit.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>🧪 What I appreciated as an advanced learner</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>The XSS section went beyond basics, requiring creative payloads to bypass context-specific filters.</li>
    <li>The CSRF lab demonstrated real-world impact, where a single forged request could escalate into full account takeover.</li>
    <li>DOM-based exercises emphasized JavaScript internals—making me think about how modern frameworks handle user input.</li>
    <li>CORS misconfigurations highlighted how a single misaligned header can collapse origin boundaries.</li>
    <li>The final challenge resembled a bug bounty target—subtle, chained, and realistic.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>🎓 Who I recommend this to</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Bug bounty hunters focusing on high-value client-side exploits (especially XSS chaining and CORS bypasses).</li>
    <li>Pentesters preparing for real-world web engagements where client-side flaws are often overlooked but impactful.</li>
    <li>Developers aiming to understand the risks of unsafe JavaScript patterns and misconfigured browser policies.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>🛠️ My Personal Tips</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>For XSS, always test multiple contexts (HTML, attributes, scripts) and remember that escaping rules differ.</li>
    <li>When testing CSRF, try removing or manipulating anti-CSRF tokens, and always check cookie settings (<code>SameSite</code>, <code>HttpOnly</code>).</li>
    <li>DOM-based attacks require analyzing the JS flow: look for sinks, tainted sources, and how data moves through the DOM.</li>
    <li>CORS bypasses often involve wildcard origins, <code>null</code> origins, or JSONP endpoints—test systematically.</li>
    <li>During challenges, think like an attacker: combine smaller issues rather than looking for a single "big bug."</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>✅ Completion Status</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Module completed: 100%</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Final thoughts:</strong> This module reinforced the idea that the browser is not a safe zone. Every assumption about trust, origin, or input can be flipped. Mastery of client-side attacks is critical for modern web pentesting and bug bounty work.</li>
  </ul>

    Client-side vulnerabilities are often underestimated—yet they open doors to account takeover, data theft, and phishing.  
    A pentester who masters both server-side and client-side flaws can dismantle an application’s security model from every angle.
