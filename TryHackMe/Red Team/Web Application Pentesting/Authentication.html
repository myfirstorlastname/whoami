  <h2>🧠 About</h2>
  <p>
    This page documents my experience with TryHackMe's 
    <a href="https://tryhackme.com/module/authentication" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"Authentication"</a> module, part of the 
    <em>Web Application Pentesting</em> learning path.  
    While authentication is a fundamental concept, this module dives deeper into real-world attack vectors, bypass techniques, and chained exploits—making it essential even for seasoned testers.
  </p>
  <p>
    My aim with this module was to refine my methodology for testing login flows, token handling, and session management. The scenarios closely mirror vulnerabilities I’ve seen during professional engagements.

  <h2>🛰️ Philosophy</h2>
  <blockquote>"Authentication is the front door. Most breaches start with a bad lock or an open window."</blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>Security is only as strong as its weakest authentication step.</li>
    <li>Every bypass is an opportunity to rethink access controls.</li>
    <li>As a pentester, my role is to prove risk, not just find a bug—showing how flaws in auth can lead to total compromise.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>🔎 Learning Outcomes: Authentication Module</h2>
  <blockquote>From brute-force to logic flaws—understanding how identity gates can be forced open.</blockquote>

  <h3>📘 Module Summary</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Covers a wide range of authentication-related vulnerabilities, including:
      <ul>
        <li>Weak password policies and brute-force attacks</li>
        <li>Credential stuffing and username enumeration</li>
        <li>Broken multi-factor authentication (MFA) flows</li>
        <li>Exploiting password reset functionality</li>
        <li>Session fixation and hijacking</li>
        <li>Logic bypasses (e.g., forced browsing, parameter tampering)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Emphasis on both manual exploitation and automation for large credential sets.</li>
    <li>Clear demonstration of how authentication flaws can chain into privilege escalation.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>🧪 What I appreciated as an advanced learner</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Realistic, multi-step scenarios that require combining techniques (e.g., username enumeration → targeted brute-force → session hijack).</li>
    <li>Focus on subtle bugs like case sensitivity issues, timing-based enumeration, and token replay.</li>
    <li>Practical use of Burp Suite features like Intruder, Comparer, and Sequencer.</li>
    <li>Coverage of secure design patterns and how to verify them.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>🎓 Who I recommend this to</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Pentesters who want a structured review of authentication attack surfaces.</li>
    <li>Developers building login and session handling mechanisms.</li>
    <li>Bug bounty hunters targeting SaaS platforms and APIs.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>🛠️ My Personal Tips</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Test password reset flows with both valid and invalid emails to check for enumeration.</li>
    <li>Try subtle case changes in usernames—some systems normalize, others don’t.</li>
    <li>Replay old tokens or cookies after logout to check for proper invalidation.</li>
    <li>When testing MFA, try skipping steps or reusing verification codes.</li>
    <li>Always check HTTP headers for leaked information like <code>Server</code>, <code>X-Powered-By</code>, or verbose error messages.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>✅ Completion Status</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Module completed: 100%</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Final thoughts:</strong> This module is a must for anyone aiming to handle web application pentests end-to-end. Authentication is often the first thing an attacker touches—knowing every possible bypass can be the difference between a partial and a full compromise.</li>
