  <h2>üß† About</h2>
  <p>
    This page documents my completion of the 
    <a href="https://tryhackme.com/module/advanced-server-side-attacks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"Advanced Server-Side Attacks"</a> 
    module, part of the <em>Web Application Pentesting</em> learning path on TryHackMe.  
    Unlike introductory modules, this one dives into high-impact vulnerabilities that target the logic and trust boundaries of server-side components.
  </p>
  <p>
    The goal of this module is not only to understand <em>what</em> these vulnerabilities are, but also <em>how</em> they chain into full exploitation scenarios such as remote code execution (RCE), lateral movement, and privilege escalation within web applications and infrastructure.  
    Each topic builds on real-world cases and requires a mix of creativity, persistence, and technical rigor.

  <h2>üõ∞Ô∏è Philosophy</h2>
  <blockquote>"When the server trusts too much, the attacker controls the narrative."</blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>Server-side flaws are not just "bugs"; they‚Äôre architectural weaknesses that can redefine trust boundaries.</li>
    <li>Attackers exploit implicit assumptions in frameworks, libraries, and runtime environments.</li>
    <li>The pentester‚Äôs responsibility is to connect the dots‚Äîfrom a single injection or race condition to systemic compromise.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>üîé Learning Outcomes: Advanced Server-Side Attacks</h2>
  <blockquote>From object serialization to race conditions‚Äîunderstanding how deep backend flaws can dismantle an entire system.</blockquote>

  <h3>üìò Module Summary</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Insecure Deserialization</strong>  
      Demonstrated how user-controlled objects can lead to arbitrary code execution when deserialized insecurely. The exercises emphasized gadget chains and the dangers of legacy or poorly designed serialization mechanisms.</li>
    <li><strong>Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)</strong>  
      Explored how web applications that fetch remote resources on behalf of the user can be tricked into accessing internal systems, metadata services, or cloud infrastructure endpoints.</li>
    <li><strong>File Inclusion & Path Traversal</strong>  
      Showed how improper path handling leads to Local File Inclusion (LFI), Remote File Inclusion (RFI), or traversal into sensitive directories. These are often chained into log poisoning or shell upload attacks.</li>
    <li><strong>Race Conditions</strong>  
      Covered how simultaneous requests can break business logic, allowing privilege escalation or unauthorized actions (e.g., double-spending, bypassing file upload filters). Timing-based exploitation and automation were key aspects.</li>
    <li><strong>Prototype Pollution</strong>  
      Highlighted a modern, JavaScript-focused vulnerability where attackers inject malicious properties into object prototypes, leading to application logic corruption or client-side RCE.</li>
    <li><strong>Include (Challenge)</strong>  
      A final, realistic scenario requiring chaining of knowledge gained throughout the module. Success depended on spotting subtle misconfigurations and escalating them into impactful compromise.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>üß™ What I appreciated as an advanced learner</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Each vulnerability was presented not in isolation but with realistic exploitation chains, forcing me to think like a real attacker.</li>
    <li>The deserialization and prototype pollution sections required deep understanding of underlying technologies, which mirrors modern pentests against microservices and JavaScript-heavy stacks.</li>
    <li>The race condition exercises demanded automation and precise timing, which is often overlooked but highly practical in financial or transactional systems.</li>
    <li>The final ‚ÄúInclude‚Äù challenge was structured to resemble a real-world penetration test, rewarding persistence and lateral thinking rather than rote knowledge.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>üéì Who I recommend this to</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Pentesters preparing for advanced certifications (OSWE, OSEP, or OSCP candidates looking to go deeper into server-side flaws).</li>
    <li>Bug bounty hunters who want to exploit non-obvious, high-impact issues often rewarded with critical severity payouts.</li>
    <li>Developers and architects aiming to understand how insecure design choices in serialization, input handling, or async code execution can compromise their applications.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>üõ†Ô∏è My Personal Tips</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>For insecure deserialization, always check for known gadget chains and look at how libraries parse objects‚Äîassume nothing is safe.</li>
    <li>SSRF often requires creativity: try various encodings, use DNS rebinding, and chain with open redirect vulnerabilities.</li>
    <li>File inclusion vulnerabilities are rarely standalone‚Äîalways test log files, session files, or uploads for code execution paths.</li>
    <li>Race conditions need automation: tools like Burp Intruder‚Äôs ‚Äúrace‚Äù mode or custom scripts with threading can make the difference.</li>
    <li>Prototype pollution is subtle‚Äîdon‚Äôt just test endpoints, test how the application stores and uses objects across its flow.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>‚úÖ Completion Status</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Module completed: 100%</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Final thoughts:</strong> This was one of the most challenging and rewarding modules in the Web Application Pentesting path. It provided not just individual techniques but a mindset‚Äîviewing the server not as a black box, but as an exploitable system of assumptions. Mastery of these vulnerabilities is essential for any pentester aiming to handle complex, modern applications.</li>
  </ul>

    Advanced server-side vulnerabilities are not ‚Äúniche‚Äù‚Äîthey are real-world attack vectors with systemic impact.  
    Understanding them is the difference between spotting a bug and mapping a complete kill chain.
