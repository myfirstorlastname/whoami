  <h2>🧠 About</h2>
  <p>
    This page documents my completion of the 
    <a href="https://tryhackme.com/module/red-team-fundamentals" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Red Team Fundamentals</a> 
    module, part of the <em>Red Teaming</em> learning path on TryHackMe.  
    Unlike exploit-heavy modules, this one provides the <strong>strategic foundations</strong> of red teaming: planning engagements, gathering threat intelligence, maintaining OPSEC, and introducing Command & Control concepts.
  </p>
  <p>
    The goal is not to teach advanced exploitation yet, but to shape the <strong>mindset of a red teamer</strong>: stealthy, intelligence-driven, and mission-oriented.

  <h2>🛰️ Philosophy</h2>
  <blockquote>"Red teams don’t just break in—they emulate real-world adversaries to test resilience."</blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>A red teamer’s job is to simulate <em>threat actors</em>, not just pentesters with exploits.</li>
    <li>Every action has an operational cost: stealth and timing matter as much as payloads.</li>
    <li>Intelligence and OPSEC define the difference between a noisy hacker and a disciplined operator.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>🔎 Learning Outcomes: Red Team Fundamentals</h2>
  <blockquote>From planning to C2—laying the groundwork for disciplined offensive operations.</blockquote>

  <h3>📘 Module Summary (Rooms)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Red Team Fundamentals</strong> — Introduced the concept of red teaming as distinct from penetration testing: mission-driven, intelligence-led, and focused on objectives rather than vulnerabilities.</li>
    <li><strong>Red Team Engagements</strong> — Explained how engagements are structured: scoping, objectives, rules of engagement (RoE), and reporting to leadership. Highlighted the difference between assumed breach vs. full-scope simulations.</li>
    <li><strong>Red Team Threat Intel</strong> — Covered how cyber threat intelligence (CTI) informs red team operations: mapping to MITRE ATT&CK, understanding adversary TTPs, and tailoring engagements accordingly.</li>
    <li><strong>Red Team OPSEC</strong> — Showed how attackers must practice strict operational security. Topics included infrastructure separation (staging vs. production C2 servers), domain fronting, blending in with normal traffic, and managing digital footprints.  
      The key idea: <em>don’t just hack—stay hidden while hacking</em>.</li>
    <li><strong>Intro to C2</strong> — Introduced Command & Control frameworks used to maintain persistence and manage compromised hosts. Covered beaconing, callbacks, staging payloads, and traffic obfuscation. Emphasized the dual challenge: reliable operator control while evading blue team detection.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>🧪 What I appreciated as a learner</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>The OPSEC section was highly practical: understanding how red teams structure their infrastructure and blend into normal network patterns.</li>
    <li>The C2 introduction made clear that real-world operations are about persistence and control—not just initial exploitation.</li>
    <li>The module forced me to think strategically: engagements are <strong>planned missions</strong>, not random exploits.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>🎓 Who I recommend this to</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Pentesters transitioning into red teaming and needing a <strong>mindset shift</strong> from vulnerabilities to adversary simulation.</li>
    <li>Defenders who want to understand <strong>how adversaries maintain stealth</strong> and why OPSEC matters for attackers.</li>
    <li>Anyone interested in adversary emulation, threat intel, or offensive security strategy.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>🛠️ My Personal Tips</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Always separate infrastructure: don’t expose your real C2 server—use redirectors and staging hosts.</li>
    <li>For OPSEC, remember that <strong>noise kills operations</strong>: automate carefully and randomize timings.</li>
    <li>When exploring C2 frameworks (Cobalt Strike, Mythic, Covenant), focus on <strong>traffic profiles</strong> and evasion techniques, not just features.</li>
    <li>Engagements are team sports: communication and documentation are as important as shells and payloads.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>✅ Completion Status</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Module completed: 100%</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Final thoughts:</strong> This module set the stage for the technical labs that follow. It framed red teaming not as a collection of exploits, but as an <em>adversarial discipline</em> combining intelligence, stealth, and long-term persistence.</li>
  </ul>

    Red teaming begins with mindset: stealth, discipline, and adversary emulation. The tools come later.
