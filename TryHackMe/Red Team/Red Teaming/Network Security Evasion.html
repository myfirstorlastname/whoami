  <h2>🧠 About</h2>
  <p>
    This page documents my completion of the 
    <a href="https://tryhackme.com/module/network-security-evasion" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
      Network Security Evasion
    </a> module, part of the <em>Red Teaming</em> learning path on TryHackMe.  
    The module introduces how modern network defenses—such as firewalls and sandboxes—work, and how attackers adapt to bypass them.  
  </p>
  <p>
    While less technical than later Red Team modules, it provides essential knowledge for operating stealthily in environments where detection systems and filtering mechanisms are deployed.

  <h2>🛰️ Philosophy</h2>
  <blockquote>"Defense dictates the rules, but attackers can always find creative detours."</blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>Evasion is not about brute force—it’s about subtlety and misdirection.</li>
    <li>Understanding the <strong>limitations of network defenses</strong> helps red teamers design payloads and operations that blend in.</li>
    <li>Every filtering system is a trade-off between <em>security</em> and <em>usability</em>—attackers exploit this balance.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>📘 Module Summary (Rooms)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Network Security Solutions</strong>  
      Overview of IDS/IPS, firewalls, and sandboxes. Emphasis on detection strategies (signature-based vs. behavioral analysis) and how attackers exploit blind spots.</li>
    <li><strong>Firewalls</strong>  
      Covered how stateful and application firewalls enforce traffic rules. Techniques for evasion included using alternate ports, tunneling traffic, fragmenting payloads, and protocol misuses.</li>
    <li><strong>Sandbox Evasion</strong>  
      Showed how attackers detect sandbox environments (e.g., virtualized hardware, limited runtime, unusual processes) and delay or obfuscate payload execution until outside the sandbox.  
      Examples: time delays, API calls that behave differently in sandboxes, and multi-stage payloads that activate only in real environments.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>🧪 What I appreciated</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Clear breakdown of <strong>defensive trade-offs</strong>—why strict filtering often gets relaxed in production.</li>
    <li>Sandbox evasion techniques felt close to real-world malware tactics, useful for pentesting awareness.</li>
    <li>The module emphasized mindset: learning to think in terms of bypassing rather than breaking.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>🎓 Who I recommend this to</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Red team beginners who want to understand the basics of bypassing firewalls and sandboxing systems.</li>
    <li>Blue teamers looking to strengthen defenses by knowing attacker evasion strategies.</li>
    <li>Anyone transitioning from lab pentesting to real-world engagements, where stealth is as important as exploitation.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>🛠️ My Personal Tips</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Always <strong>fingerprint the environment</strong>—knowing what firewall or sandbox is in place guides your evasion strategy.</li>
    <li>For sandbox evasion, study malware analysis reports—they’re goldmines of creative techniques.</li>
    <li>Never underestimate <strong>protocol abuse</strong>: HTTP smuggling, DNS tunneling, or using WebSockets often slip through filters.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>✅ Completion Status</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Module completed: 100%</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Final thoughts:</strong> This module reinforced the idea that red teaming is as much about stealth and bypass as it is about exploitation.  
    Firewalls and sandboxes raise the bar, but with creativity, evasion is always possible.</li>
  </ul>
