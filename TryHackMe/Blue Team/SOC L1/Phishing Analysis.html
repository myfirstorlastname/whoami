  <h1>📩 Phishing Analysis (TryHackMe : SAL1 path)</h1>
  <blockquote>Pseudonymous cybersecurity enthusiast progressing toward CySA+ (CS0-003).</blockquote>

  <h2>🧠 About</h2>
  <p>This page covers the <strong>Phishing Analysis</strong> module from the <a href="https://tryhackme.com/path/outline/soclevel1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SOC Level 1</a> learning path on TryHackMe.<br />
     It focuses on the identification, investigation, and prevention of phishing emails — one of the most common attack vectors in enterprise environments. The module trains both technical analysis (headers, payloads, URLs) and contextual investigation.</p>

  <h2>🛰️ Philosophy</h2>
  <blockquote>"A single click can breach a network. A trained eye can stop it."</blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>Phishing isn't just about spam detection — it's about context, intent, and deception.</li>
    <li>As an analyst, knowing how to dissect a suspicious email is key to:
      <ul>
        <li>Identifying threats early</li>
        <li>Improving user awareness</li>
        <li>Protecting broader infrastructure</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>📘 Topics and Labs Covered</h2>
  <blockquote>From fake invoices to malware loaders</blockquote>

  <h3>📧 Phishing Analysis Fundamentals</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Types of phishing: credential harvesting, malicious attachments, spear phishing, whaling</li>
    <li>How attackers craft convincing lures and evade detection</li>
    <li>Email header structure and spoofing techniques</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>🔬 Phishing Emails in Action</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Hands-on analysis of real-world phishing samples</li>
    <li>Extracting indicators from headers and content</li>
    <li>Identifying obfuscation techniques and social engineering clues</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>🛠️ Phishing Analysis Tools</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Using:
      <ul>
        <li><code>email-header-analyzer</code> and <code>phish.tool</code></li>
        <li>VirusTotal and URLScan for link checking</li>
        <li>OLETools for attachment analysis (Office macros)</li>
        <li>CyberChef for decoding or deobfuscating payloads</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>🛡️ Phishing Prevention</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>SPF, DKIM, DMARC — how email authentication works</li>
    <li>Security awareness tips to reduce user-level risk</li>
    <li>Technical countermeasures (sandboxing, filtering, quarantining)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>🎯 Phishing Challenges</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>The Greenholt Phish</strong> – Full investigation of a phishing case: headers, links, attachment, and campaign context</li>
    <li><strong>Snapped Phish-ing Line</strong> – A challenge in reconstructing attacker intent from partial evidence</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>🎯 Key Takeaways</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>I’m now comfortable breaking down and analyzing phishing attempts end-to-end</li>
    <li>I can identify spoofing, encoding tricks, and track threat actors via recurring patterns</li>
    <li>I understand how to combine technical analysis with human context (intent, timing, language)</li>
    <li>I see phishing not just as an attack, but as an opportunity to educate and defend</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Next step: build detection rules based on email telemetry, and simulate spear phishing in a test environment for defensive drills.</p>
