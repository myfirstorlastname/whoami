  <h1>üï∂Ô∏è OSCP journey</h1>
  <blockquote>Anonymous cyber passionate on his journey to the OSCP</blockquote>
  <hr />

  <h2>üß† About</h2>
  <p>I'm a pseudonymous cybersecurity professional with expertise in offensive security, SOC analysis, and secure system design.<br />
  This article outlines my journey from Zero to OSCP.<br />
  <strong>No certificate. Just tenacity.</strong></p>
  <hr />

  <h2>üõ∞Ô∏è Philosophy</h2>
  <blockquote>"Slow and steady wins the prize."</blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>I try & fail first, learn after</li>
    <li>I value consistency and persistence</li>
  </ul>

  <hr />

  <h2>Roadmap to OSCP</h2>
  <blockquote>From Zero to OSCP : What to do without prior experience ?</blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>To be honnest : I was not starting from Zero, I had some basic knowledge from engineering school and a first blue team experience as an intern.</li>
    <li>But those experiences gave me no deep technical/theoretical understanding of the red team world.</li>
    <li>I considered myself a true beginner.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>The first step : CTFs</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>My first real step into hacking was to give myself time : time to learn.</li>
    <li>I first learned how much of a beginner I was : everything was new to me, I had some basic knowledge on a few things, but that's it.</li>
    <li>How did I learn this lesson ? I challenged the CTFs on RootMe in no specific order.</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>After some time, I sharpened my skills to find where the flags are hidden, but that's no hacking.</li>
    <li>After one year I had some good rank on the RootMe website, so I decided to move on with something new.</li>
    <li>During that year I realised that web was easier than systems and such, so I decided to specialize myself in web.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>The second step : Specialization</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>This step was imposed to me as I couldn't solve any more CTFs on RootMe (too hard).</li>
    <li>I searched on the internet a new CTF-like website specialized in web hacking for beginners, I found : webhacking.kr</li>
    <li>There, I learned what is OWASP top 10. In two months I finished almost all the CTFs on this site, it was a real fast scale-up of my skills.</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>Once done with webhacking.kr, and following jobs interviewers' advice (as I was refused to many pentest jobs), I started my real work on OWASP : PortSwigger</li>
    <li>PortSwigger was developped by the OWASP Foundation, they also developped THE web tool : Burp Suite.</li>
    <li>I spent months on these labs : XSS, SQLi, CSRF, HTTP Request Smuggling, to finally get an overall understanding of the background mechanisms on the web.</li>
    <li>I got a good understanding of Client-side browsers, Server-side requests, Front-end/Back-end Servers, Web Application Firewalls, Databases.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>The third step : Real-world</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>This step was imposed to me as I still had no income, I chose to work as a freelance bug bounty hunter on HackerOne.</li>
    <li>I found some small vulnerabilites that I reported with exploits, but these gave me no income as they were duplicates : $0.</li>
    <li>The only way to get paid is to be on an old program already 99.9% secure, and still find the small vulnerability hidden. But honestly even if you find one, the small bounty isn't worse the time.</li>
    <li>However I learnt some valuable skills : automation, R&D, how to use Burp Suite more efficiently...</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>The fourth step : Blue team</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>As I still had no income two years after my engineer graduation (and persistently applying for every red team opportunity), I decided to go back to blue team.</li>
    <li>To have a chance in a SOC environment (after two years), I had to rebuild my blue team skillset from scratch without a proper env.</li>
    <li>That's how I discovered TryHackMe labs. Their labs are great and really well documented. Lots of forums on THM labs.</li>
    <li>I passed the SOC N1 cert delivered by THM, and began the N2 course.</li>
    <li>With this SOC knowledge, I decided to apply to every blue team opportunity. (and still applied to red team)</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>The fifth step : OSCP ?</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>I already heard of the OSCP and other certs such as Burp Suite cert, but never asked myself : Why would I not attempt it ?</li>
    <li>Often some interviewer gave me the advice to get the OSCP. During these times, I had really good technical knowledge on web, and they felt it (but I suppose there's always someone better for the job...)</li>
    <li>Seeing my limitations : I had the skills, but still couldn't get a job ; I decided to invest time specifically for preparing the OSCP.</li>
    <li>What is OSCP ?</li>
    <li>It's a certification delivered by Offsec that says : This guy has basic professionnal red team skills.</li>
    <li>It's focused on Active Directory (AD) and with some web hacking parts.</li>
    <li>I was specialized in web hacking, but had no skills on AD, so I turned to TryHackme.</li>
    <li>TryHackMe has some really good red team courses : I began immediatly with the AD labs.</li>
    <li>I started with Attacktive Directory, then Breaching AD, Enumerating AD, ...</li>
    <li>That's where I'm at today.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>The last step : get the OSCP and a job !</h3>
