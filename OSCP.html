  <h1>🕶️ My OSCP Journey: From Curiosity to Offensive Security</h1>
  <blockquote>Anonymous cyber passionate on his journey to the OSCP</blockquote>
  <hr />

  <h2>🧠 About</h2>
  <p>I'm a pseudonymous cybersecurity professional with expertise in offensive security, SOC analysis, and secure system design.<br />
  Welcome!</br>
    This page outlines my self-driven journey toward becoming an Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP). It showcases the progression of my technical skills—from entry-level hacking labs to Active Directory exploitation—designed for recruiters and cybersecurity professionals who want a clear picture of my dedication and capabilities.<br />
  </p>
  <hr />

  <h2>🛰️ Philosophy</h2>
  <blockquote>"Slow and steady wins the prize."</blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>I try & fail first, learn after</li>
    <li>I value consistency and persistence</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Roadmap to OSCP</h2>
  <blockquote>From Zero to OSCP : What to do without prior experience ?</blockquote>
  <h3>Getting Started: CTF Foundations (RootMe)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>In late 2022, I began exploring Capture the Flag (CTF) platforms with little prior knowledge. I chose RootMe.org as my primary training ground due to its wide range of challenges. Over several months:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>I built strong foundations in Linux, HTTP protocols, file permissions, and command-line exploitation.</li>
      <li>I consistently avoided hints to push myself further and better simulate real-world problem solving.</li>
      <li>Eventually, I ranked in the top 1% globally, a milestone that validated my early learning process.</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <h3>Specializing in Web Security</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Recognizing a strong interest in web vulnerabilities, I deepened my skills through multiple structured platforms:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Webhacking.kr: I completed most challenges without walkthroughs, gaining exposure to XSS, SQLi, and logic flaws.</li>
      <li>PortSwigger Web Security Academy: Completed over 75% of labs, covering advanced topics like server-side request forgery (SSRF), deserialization, and HTTP smuggling.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>This phase sharpened my understanding of real-world attack vectors and strengthened my debugging and automation skills.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Bug Bounty Practice on HackerOne</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>To apply my web skills in live environments, I began practicing on HackerOne’s public programs. Although I didn't secure financial rewards, the experience was valuable:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>I submitted multiple reports; several were valid but marked as duplicates.</li>
      <li>I used tools like Burp Suite Pro, ffuf, and ParamSpider to identify potential issues.</li>
      <li>The key takeaway: learning to identify subtle logic vulnerabilities and read between the lines of complex web apps.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>This hands-on exposure helped me better understand the bounty ecosystem and report-writing expectations.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Blue Team Insight: SOC Level Training</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>To round out my skill set, I explored the defensive side of cybersecurity:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Enrolled in TryHackMe's “SOC Level 1” path and am progressing toward Level 2.</li>
      <li>Learned to navigate SIEMs, analyze Windows Event Logs, and detect common attacks like brute force, malware execution, and privilege escalation.</li>
      <li>Practiced correlating logs, creating alerts, and simulating investigations from start to finish.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Understanding the defender’s perspective has significantly improved my ability to design realistic offensive strategies.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Toward OSCP: Active Directory, Buffer Overflows & More</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>In preparation for the OSCP, I shifted focus to realistic enterprise scenarios:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Completed dozens of TryHackMe labs focusing on Active Directory (AD), Kerberoasting, AS-REP Roasting, and BloodHound enumeration.</li>
      <li>Practiced buffer overflows, Windows privilege escalation, and pivoting techniques in lab environments.</li>
      <li>Developed a methodical approach to enumeration, privesc, and post-exploitation reporting.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>I'm currently deepening my knowledge on pivoting through networks and custom payload creation, two key components of the OSCP exam.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>What’s Next?</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>I plan to take the OSCP exam in the coming months. My current focus: refining my workflow and improving time management during engagements.</li>
    <li>My ultimate goal is to join a Red Team or penetration testing role where I can continue learning, breaking things, and contributing to real-world security improvements.</li>
  </ul>
