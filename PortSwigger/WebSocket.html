      "WebSockets create a live channel between client and server—if not secured, attackers can eavesdrop, hijack, or manipulate the stream."

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      WebSockets provide a persistent, full-duplex communication channel between a client and a server.  
      They are widely used in modern applications for real-time updates such as chat systems, financial dashboards, or multiplayer games.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, if WebSocket messages and handshakes are not properly validated and secured, they expose new attack surfaces.  
      The following PortSwigger labs illustrate common <strong>WebSocket vulnerabilities</strong> and how attackers exploit them.
    </p>

    <h2>Labs</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Manipulating WebSocket messages to exploit vulnerabilities</strong> – Injecting malicious payloads directly into WebSocket messages to exploit weaknesses in server-side processing.</li>
      <li><strong>Cross-site WebSocket hijacking</strong> – Forcing a victim’s browser to establish a malicious WebSocket connection, leading to account takeover or data exfiltration.</li>
      <li><strong>Manipulating the WebSocket handshake to exploit vulnerabilities</strong> – Tampering with the initial handshake request (headers, origin checks) to bypass security controls.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Always <strong>validate and sanitize WebSocket messages</strong> on the server side—never trust client input.</li>
      <li>Enforce strict <strong>origin checks</strong> during the handshake to prevent cross-site hijacking.</li>
      <li>Apply the same <strong>authentication and authorization controls</strong> to WebSockets as you would to HTTP requests.</li>
      <li>Monitor and log WebSocket traffic—real-time channels can hide attacks if left unchecked.</li>
    </ul>
  </main>

    <p>
      WebSockets expand the attack surface—without strict validation, attackers can turn real-time features into real-time exploits.
