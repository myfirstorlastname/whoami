  <h1>üåê Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) Vulnerabilities</h1>
  <blockquote>Cross-domain trust is a privilege ‚Äî never a default.</blockquote>

  <h2>üß† What is CORS?</h2>
  <p>
    Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a mechanism that allows web applications to request resources from a different domain than their own.
    While it is essential for modern web functionality, a misconfigured CORS policy can let attackers access sensitive data or perform actions on behalf of a victim.
  </p>
  <p>
    CORS issues often stem from overly permissive <code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin</code> headers, or trusting origins that can be controlled or spoofed by an attacker.
  </p>

  <h2>üß™ My Lab Progress</h2>
  <p>I completed <strong>3 out of 3</strong> CORS labs on PortSwigger Academy.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>CORS vulnerability with basic origin reflection</li>
    <li>CORS vulnerability with trusted null origin</li>
    <li>CORS vulnerability with trusted insecure protocols</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>üß© Real-World Applications</h2>
  <p>
    CORS vulnerabilities are rarely the main entry point in an attack chain but can have significant impact when combined with other flaws such as XSS, session fixation, or weak authentication.
    In a real-world scenario, exploiting misconfigured CORS can allow:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Reading sensitive API responses from a victim‚Äôs authenticated session</li>
    <li>Stealing personal data or internal configuration information</li>
    <li>Bypassing same-origin policy to pivot into private APIs</li>
    <li>Combining with XSS to exfiltrate data cross-domain</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>üß† Key Takeaways</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Never use <code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *</code> with credentials allowed.</li>
    <li>Validate and strictly define trusted origins ‚Äî avoid reflection of user input.</li>
    <li>Be cautious with <code>null</code> origins (common in sandboxed iframes and local files).</li>
    <li>Secure endpoints with proper authentication and CSRF protections, even with CORS restrictions.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>üß∞ Tools & Tips</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Use Burp Suite to intercept requests and manipulate <code>Origin</code> headers.</li>
    <li>Test for <code>Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true</code> combined with permissive origins.</li>
    <li>Leverage browser DevTools to observe CORS errors and debug policy behavior.</li>
    <li>Automate origin fuzzing to detect weak validation logic.</li>
  </ul>

    CORS is a gatekeeper between domains ‚Äî configure it with the same caution as you would a firewall.
