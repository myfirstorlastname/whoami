  <h2>🧠 About</h2>
  <p>This page documents my work on the <strong>Cyber Threat Intelligence</strong> module, part of the <a href="https://tryhackme.com/path/outline/soclevel1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SOC Level 1</a> learning path on TryHackMe.<br />
     This module focuses on understanding the nature of cyber threats, and how to collect, structure, and act on intelligence. It introduces tools, data sources, and strategic thinking used by CTI analysts in both operational and tactical environments.

  <h2>🛰️ Philosophy</h2>
  <blockquote>"You can't defend what you don't understand. Intelligence gives context."</blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) allows security teams to:
      <ul>
        <li>Anticipate emerging threats</li>
        <li>Map adversary behavior across campaigns</li>
        <li>Refine detection and response strategies</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>It’s the strategic layer that informs everything from IOC correlation to threat hunting.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>📘 Concepts and Tools Explored</h2>
  <blockquote>From IOC to campaign tracking: tools and mindset of modern CTI</blockquote>

  <h3>🧭 Intro to Cyber Threat Intelligence</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Understanding the differences between:
      <ul>
        <li>Strategic, Operational, Tactical, and Technical intelligence</li>
        <li>Threat feeds vs curated intelligence</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Lifecycle of CTI: collection → processing → analysis → dissemination</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>🛠️ Threat Intelligence Tools</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Overview of platforms and tools used to gather and correlate intelligence:
      <ul>
        <li>VirusTotal, AbuseIPDB, Shodan, GreyNoise</li>
        <li>OSINT basics and enrichment techniques</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Linking artifacts (hashes, IPs, URLs) to threat actors or malware families</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>🔍 YARA Rules</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Writing YARA rules to detect patterns in binaries or memory dumps</li>
    <li>Use cases: malware classification, threat hunting, IOC triage</li>
    <li>Hands-on practice with syntax, conditions, and strings</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>🌐 OpenCTI</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Introduction to the OpenCTI platform (Open Cyber Threat Intelligence)</li>
    <li>Structuring threat data, mapping relationships, visualizing campaigns</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>🧩 MISP (Malware Information Sharing Platform)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Hands-on use of MISP to:
      <ul>
        <li>Ingest and share threat indicators</li>
        <li>Create structured events and attributes</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Collaboration and sharing between SOCs, CERTs, and partners</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>🧠 Bonus Labs</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Friday Overtime</strong> – Additional practical scenario for applying threat analysis techniques</li>
    <li><strong>Trooper</strong> – Applied threat intel mapping and adversary tracking</li>
  </ul>

  <hr>
  <h2>🎯 Key Takeaways</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Threat Intelligence is not just data—it's about context and correlation.</li>
    <li>Writing YARA rules gave me better intuition for malware pattern matching.</li>
    <li>MISP and OpenCTI taught me how to structure threat information professionally.</li>
    <li>I now understand how CTI feeds into incident response, detection engineering, and risk assessment.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Next step: integrate CTI insights into log correlation and detection pipelines.</p>
