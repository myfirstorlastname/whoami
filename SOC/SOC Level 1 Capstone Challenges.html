  <h2>🧠 About</h2>
  <p>This page highlights my final step in completing the <strong>SOC Level 1</strong> learning path on TryHackMe: the <em>Capstone Challenges</em>.<br />
     These scenarios are designed to simulate real-world incidents and test everything learned throughout the path — from log analysis and forensics to phishing triage and threat detection.<br />
     I completed this set of challenges and earned the <strong>SOC Level 1 Certificate</strong>, which is available on my LinkedIn profile.<br />
     (Note: To preserve anonymity here, I do not link to LinkedIn directly.)</p>

  <h2>🛰️ Philosophy</h2>
  <blockquote>"Theory is practice rehearsed. Practice is theory applied."</blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>The capstone validates skills across the entire blue team stack:
      <ul>
        <li>Endpoint and network telemetry</li>
        <li>Threat intel and detection logic</li>
        <li>Analytical mindset under pressure</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>For me, this was less about passing a test — and more about proving to myself that I could investigate, correlate, and act like a real SOC analyst.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>📜 Certification</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>✅ All Capstone Labs Completed</li>
    <li>📄 Certification earned: <strong>SOC Level 1 (TryHackMe)</strong></li>
    <li>🔒 Proof of certification is visible on my <em>LinkedIn profile</em> (not linked here to maintain anonymity)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>This module was the culmination of weeks of structured learning. It proved that knowledge is not just memorized — it's operationalized. I’m now confident operating in entry-level SOC environments and continuing toward CySA+ and beyond.</p>
