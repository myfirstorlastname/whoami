  <h1>üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Active Directory : Training</h1>
  <blockquote>Anonymous cyber passionate on his journey to the OSCP</blockquote>
  <hr />

  <h2>üß† About</h2>
  <p>I'm a pseudonymous cybersecurity professional with expertise in offensive security, SOC analysis, and secure system design.<br />
     This page outlines my self-driven journey toward becoming an Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP). It showcases the progression of my Active Directory technical skills‚Äîfrom basic knowledge to Active Directory exploitation‚Äîdesigned for recruiters and cybersecurity professionals who want a clear picture of my dedication and capabilities.<br />
  </p>
  <hr />

  <h2>üõ∞Ô∏è Philosophy</h2>
  <blockquote>"Slow and steady wins the prize."</blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>I believe offensive security is not about being the smartest person in the room‚Äîit‚Äôs about resilience, curiosity, and method. I treat pen-testing like a craft: solve, reflect, repeat. My learning philosophy includes:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Try ‚Üí Fail ‚Üí Learn: I embrace discomfort as a sign of growth.</li>
      <li>Consistency over bursts: A few focused hours every day beats weekend marathons.</li>
      <li>Depth over tools: I master concepts, not just commands.</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>

  <h2>üîê Roadmap to Active Directory Administrator</h2>
  <blockquote>From basic knowledge to Active Directory Admin</blockquote>
  <h3>üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started: What is an Active Directory (AD) ?</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Up to this point I had a focus on web hacking through different experiences. In order to prepare the OSCP : I have to master AD concepts and attack techniques.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>I had prior knowledge of AD through my engineering degree.</li>
      <li>At this point, I didn't know the deep concepts of AD, nor had I real understanding of the AD protocols (LDAP, DHCP, DNS, Kerberos).</li>
      <li>I worked on these concepts on the TryHackMe labs.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>A directory is a hierarchical structure that stores information about objects on a network. A directory service, such as <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/get-started/virtual-dc/active-directory-domain-services-overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)</a>, provides the methods for storing directory data and making this data available to network users and administrators. For example, AD DS stores information about user accounts, such as names, passwords, phone numbers, and so on. AD DS also provides a way for authorized users on the same network to access this information.</li>
  </ul>
