  <h2>üß† About</h2>
  <p>I'm a pseudonymous cybersecurity professional with expertise in offensive security, SOC analysis, and secure system design.<br />
     BSCP (Burp Suite Certified Practitioner) is a hands-on certification by PortSwigger that validates expertise in web application security and offensive testing using Burp Suite.</br>
     This page outlines my self-driven journey toward becoming a Burp Suite Certified Practitioner (BSCP). It showcases the progression of my web-offensive technical skills‚Äîfrom basic knowledge to OWASP mastery. This page is designed for recruiters and cybersecurity professionals who want a clear picture of my dedication and capabilities.<br />
  </p>
  <hr>

  <h2>üõ∞Ô∏è Philosophy</h2>
  <blockquote>"Slow and steady wins the prize."</blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>I believe web-offensive security is not about being the smartest person in the room‚Äîit‚Äôs about practice, deep comprehension of infrastructures, and method. I treat working as a web bug bounty hunter as a craft: recon, exploit, report, repeat. My learning philosophy includes:
      <ul>
        <li>Try ‚Üí Fail ‚Üí Learn: I embrace discomfort as a sign of growth.</li>
        <li>Consistency over bursts: A few focused hours every day beats weekend marathons.</li>
        <li>Depth over tools: I master concepts, not just tools.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>üîê Roadmap to Web Hacking</h2>
  <blockquote>From basic knowledge to OWASP mastery</blockquote>
  <h3>üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started: What is OWASP top 10 ?</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>I began my journey into offensive cybersecurity with a fundamental question: How can I transition into a professional offensive security role?
      <ul>
        <li>I had almost no prior experience in offensive security.</li>
        <li>At this point, I didn't know the different roles that coexist in offensive security, nor did I have a real understanding of their missions.</li>
        <li>I decided to actively apply to any junior offensive roles.</li>
        <li>At that point, without a primary professional engagement, I decided to actively develop my skills and deepen my knowledge in cybersecurity: I started doing CTFs on RootMe.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OWASP Top 10</a> is a standard awareness document for developers and web application security. It represents a broad consensus about the most critical security risks to web applications.</li>
  </ul>
  <hr>
  <h3>üí• The CTFs world</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_the_flag_(cybersecurity)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Capture the Flag</a> (CTF) in computer security is an exercise in which participants attempt to find text strings, called "flags", which are secretly hidden in purposefully vulnerable programs or websites. They can be used for both competitive and educational purposes.</li>
    <li>I practiced and understood key concepts of attacking.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>üïµ Professional activity: Bug Bounty Hunter</h3>
  <h4>‚õâ <a href="https://www.hackerone.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HackerOne</a></h4>
  <ul>
    <li>While upgrading my skills, I still had no professional cybersecurity role. I thus became a bug bounty hunter on HackerOne.
      <ul>
        <li>I had no prior real-world experience in webhacking.</li>
        <li>I gathered intel on: what is a scope, a bug bounty program, a report.</li>
        <li>I challenged my first bug, and this mission lasted one month. It was a medium-sized website with basic functionalities, and the program was open to all.</li>
        <li>I chose this program because it was recently opened and was likely to have some vulnerabilities.</li>
        <li>However, recent programs never reward hunters even if the hunter submit a report containing an exploitable critical vulnerability on a key asset.</li>
        <li>This initial mission allowed me to apply my technical skills in a real-world context, resulting in the submission of several valid reports.</li>
        <li>After this I tried old programs with rewards, but I found in one year of work less than 5 valid exploitables vulns on such programs.</li>
        <li>The reason being that these older programs are already 99% secure in this process:
          <ul>
            <li>The entreprise validates the security of their website through a private team of pentesters.</li>
            <li>They open a bug bounty program to the 10 best bug bounty hunters, that will clear any remaining vulnerability.</li>
            <li>Eventually, a public program is created where I, and all bug bounty hunters in the world can search vulnerabilities.</li>
            <li>One may wonder why such programs are made public if they are already considered secure.</li>
            <li>The rationale is that websites change with every update, and new zero-day vulnerabilities emerge frequently. This is the company's view of the bug bounty hunter's role.</li>
            <li>As a result, only the top-ranked hunters typically earn a sustainable income through this activity.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Ultimately, all of the valid reports I submitted on older programs were marked as duplicates.</li>
        <li>Duplicate reports are generally not rewarded, as recognition is typically granted on a first-come, first-served basis.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Despite all the above downsides of this activity, I learnt more in this year than I could in professional roles:
      <ul>
        <li>How to approach the recon phase.</li>
        <li>How to gather specific intel from resources on the internet: resembling open-source intelligence (OSINT) methodologies</li>
        <li>Where to expect vulnerabilities: Profile page, custom error page</li>
        <li>How to exploit the vulnerability, and to quickly assess whether an exploit path is viable or not.</li>
        <li>How to chain attacks to further exploit different minor vulnerabilities: IDOR+XSS</li>
        <li>How to write a custom report: Good practices, Reproducible exploit (screenshots), Mitigations and Recommendations</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
