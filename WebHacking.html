  <h2>üß† About</h2>
  <p>I'm a pseudonymous cybersecurity professional with expertise in offensive security, SOC analysis, and secure system design.<br />
     This page outlines my self-driven journey toward becoming a Burp Suite Certified Practitioner (BSCP). It showcases the progression of my web-offensive technical skills‚Äîfrom basic knowledge to OWASP mastery‚Äîdesigned for recruiters and cybersecurity professionals who want a clear picture of my dedication and capabilities.<br />
  </p>
  <hr>

  <h2>üõ∞Ô∏è Philosophy</h2>
  <blockquote>"Slow and steady wins the prize."</blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>I believe web-offensive security is not about being the smartest person in the room‚Äîit‚Äôs about practice, deep comprehension of infrastructures, and method. I treat working as a web bug bounty hunter as a craft: recon, exploit, report, repeat. My learning philosophy includes:
      <ul>
        <li>Try ‚Üí Fail ‚Üí Learn: I embrace discomfort as a sign of growth.</li>
        <li>Consistency over bursts: A few focused hours every day beats weekend marathons.</li>
        <li>Depth over tools: I master concepts, not just tools.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>üîê Roadmap to Web Hacking</h2>
  <blockquote>From basic knowledge to OWASP mastery</blockquote>
  <h3>üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started: What is OWASP top 10 ?</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>I began my journey into the cybersecurity field (after my six-month internship as a SOC Analyst) with a question: How to get hired in offensive cybersecurity ?
      <ul>
        <li>I had almost no prior experience in offensive security.</li>
        <li>At this point, I didn't know the different roles that coexist in offensive security, nor did I have a real understanding of the their missions.</li>
        <li>I decided to actively apply to any junior offensive roles.</li>
        <li>That's when, without main activity, I decided to actively upscale my skills and knowledge in cybersecurity: I began CTFs on RootMe.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OWASP Top 10</a> is a standard awareness document for developers and web application security. It represents a broad consensus about the most critical security risks to web applications.</li>
  </ul>
  <hr>
  <h3>üí• The CTFs world</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_the_flag_(cybersecurity)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Capture the Flag</a> (CTF) in computer security is an exercise in which participants attempt to find text strings, called "flags", which are secretly hidden in purposefully vulnerable programs or websites. They can be used for both competitive or educational purposes.</li>
    <li>I practiced and understood key concepts of attacking.</li>
  </ul>
  <h4><a href="https://www.root-me.org/lfbr78" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RootMe</a></h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Over five hundred challenges available to learn hacking.</li>
    <li>Practice security and hacking challenges. Forensics, cracking, web, cryptanalysis, network, etc.</li>
  </ul>
  <h5>Web - Server</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>Discover the mechanisms, protocols and technologies used on the Internet and learn to abuse them!</li>
    <li>These challenges are designed to train users on HTML, HTTP and other server side mechanisms. The following series of challenges will cultivate a better understanding of techniques such as : Basic workings of multiple authentication mechanisms, handling form data, inner workings of web applications, etc. ...</li>
    <li>96 challenges: 70% completion</li>
  </ul>
  <h5>Web - Client</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>Client-side technologies implemented in the web browser</li>
    <li>At first you will be faced with problems that will require little to no knowledge of web scripting language. Pretty soon the plot thickens ...</li>
    <li>These challenges confront you to the use of scripting languages and client-side programming. They are mostly scripts to analyze and understand. This will allow you to learn languages which are in widespread use on the internet.</li>
    <li>42 challenges: 66% completion</li>
  </ul>
