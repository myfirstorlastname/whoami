    <h1>Black-box Penetration Test : Browsed</h1>
  </header>

  <section>
    <h2>🧠 About</h2>
    <p>Browsed is a medium difficulty Linux machine exposing a web application that processes user-supplied archives.</p>
    <p>Improper handling of uploaded ZIP files results in arbitrary Chrome extension execution.</p>
    <p>This allows bypassing localhost trust boundaries and leads to remote code execution as a local user.</p>
    <p>A misconfigured sudo Python script is then abused to escalate privileges to root.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>VPN</h2>
    <p>Connect to the VPN using openvpn.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Scan</h2>
    <p>Scan the target with nmap.</p>
    <p>Open ports discovered: 22, 80.</p>

    <h2>User - RCE via Manifest Abuse and Untrusted File Upload</h2>
    <p>Untrusted File Upload: Upload a ZIP, it'll be automatically extracted and considered as a Chrome extension.</p>
    <p>Manifest Abuse: Write your own Manifest.json file and refer your exploit in it.</p>
    <p>RCE: A vulnerable routine endpoint allows arbitrary command execution [[ "$1" -eq 0 ]], so bash will execute your command before there is a comparison.</p>

    <h2>Root - Privilege Escalation via Python Bytecode Cache Poisoning</h2>
    <p>Credential Access: SSH private keys are recovered from the compromised user account.</p>
    <p>Sudo Misconfiguration: The user can execute a Python script as root without a password.</p>
    <p>Insecure Python Import: The script imports a local module using cached bytecode.</p>
    <p>Bytecode Poisoning: A world-writable <code>__pycache__</code> directory allows execution of attacker-controlled code as root.</p>
    <p>ROOT</p>

    <p>Trusting client-side artifacts turns browsers into attack platforms.</p>
    <p>When root trusts cached code, every user becomes a compiler.</p>
