  <h2>🧠 About</h2>
  <p>This page summarizes my progress through the <strong>Vulnerability Research</strong> module from TryHackMe's Jr Penetration Tester path. Although I’m already experienced in vulnerability analysis, I used this module to reflect on teaching fundamentals and to practice a structured audit workflow.</p>
  <p>It introduces foundational knowledge about software flaws, CVEs, exploits, and how to think like an attacker or reverse engineer.</p>

  <h2>🛰️ Philosophy</h2>
  <blockquote>"Curiosity is the root of every exploit."</blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>Learning vulnerabilities isn’t just about memorizing CVEs—it’s about understanding root causes.</li>
    <li>I emphasize deep comprehension over tools and scripts. This makes exploitation reusable and portable across targets.</li>
    <li>I document my thinking more than my tools.</li>
  </ul>

  <hr>

  <h2>🧪 Key Topics Covered</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Understanding software bugs and how they turn into exploits</li>
    <li>Interpreting CVE details and impact scores</li>
    <li>Searching public exploit databases like Exploit-DB</li>
    <li>Using <code>searchsploit</code> to match exploits to discovered services</li>
    <li>Basic Linux and Windows vulnerability types (SUIDs, misconfigurations, known exploits)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>🔍 What I Found Valuable</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Good real-world framing of common services (e.g., vsftpd, Samba) and how outdated versions matter.</li>
    <li>The module reinforces responsible disclosure and real-world risk evaluation.</li>
    <li>Great context for understanding the "why" behind privilege escalation scripts and enumeration.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>🎯 Who Should Study This</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Junior pentesters needing grounding in CVEs and software flaws.</li>
    <li>CTF players learning to transition into real-world pentesting.</li>
    <li>Bug bounty beginners who want to go beyond recon into exploit logic.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>🛠️ Practical Advice</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Don’t skip version banners during enumeration. They're a treasure trove.</li>
    <li>Use <code>searchsploit</code> and <code>exploit-db</code> regularly—even when you think you know the service.</li>
    <li>Follow the timeline of vulnerabilities: read CVEs, then see how they’re patched.</li>
    <li>Rebuild PoCs from scratch if you can—it solidifies understanding and builds skill.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>✅ Completion Status</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Module completed: 100%</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Final thoughts:</strong> This module bridges enumeration and real-world exploitation. It encourages a research mindset that’s vital for growth beyond checklists and tooling.</li>
  </ul>
