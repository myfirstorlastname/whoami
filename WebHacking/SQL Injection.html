  <h1>üìù SQL Injection : Course</h1>

  <h2>üß† About</h2>
  <p>I'm a pseudonymous cybersecurity professional with expertise in offensive security, SOC analysis, and secure system design.<br />
     BSCP (Burp Suite Certified Practitioner) is a hands-on certification by PortSwigger that validates expertise in web application security and offensive testing using Burp Suite.<br />
     This page documents a course I created for self-study to further my own mastery over the basics of SQL Injection. It showcases the different types of SQL Injection. This page is designed for cybersecurity enthusiasts.<br />
     <a href="https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SQL injection</a> (SQLi) is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to interfere with the queries that an application makes to its database. This can allow an attacker to view data that they are not normally able to retrieve. This might include data that belongs to other users, or any other data that the application can access. In many cases, an attacker can modify or delete this data, causing persistent changes to the application's content or behavior.

  <h2>üõ∞Ô∏è Philosophy</h2>
  <blockquote>"Slow and steady wins the prize."</blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>I believe web-offensive security is not about being the smartest person in the room‚Äîit‚Äôs about practice, deep comprehension of infrastructures, and method. I treat working as a web bug bounty hunter as a craft: recon, exploit, report, repeat. My learning philosophy includes:
      <ul>
        <li>Try ‚Üí Fail ‚Üí Learn: I embrace discomfort as a sign of growth.</li>
        <li>Consistency over bursts: A few focused hours every day beats weekend marathons.</li>
        <li>Depth over tools: I master concepts, not just tools.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>üõ¢Ô∏è Roadmap to SQL server</h2>
  <blockquote>From basic knowledge to SQL Injection mastery</blockquote>
  <h3>üõ†Ô∏è Structured Query Language (Previously named: Sequel)</h3>
  <p>SQL is the foundational language used to manage and interact with relational databases. Its widespread adoption makes it a critical component of most modern applications.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <ul>
        <li>SQL is a language used to communicate with a database server.</li>
        <li>We can perform some requests : queries that ask the server to :
          <ul>
            <li>Retrieve specific data in the database ;</li>
            <li>Update a certain piece of data ;</li>
            <li>Delete certain data ;</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>We can do more complex queries, such as crossing data by joining different tables.</li>
        <li>A database is the building, while the tables are the floors, each floor contains rooms: these rooms are the data.</li>
        <li>The tables are structured by columns, each column represents a characteristic of the data: its value, its length, type, use.</li>
        <li>Examples of relational database systems include PostgreSQL, MySQL, and Oracle. Some databases like PostgreSQL support object-relational features.</li>
        <li>But the SQL language doesn't change, only specific functions are different depending on the database: Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Here are some common queries:
      <p><strong>Where Clause:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name WHERE condition;</li>
        <li>SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE condition1 AND condition2;</li>
        <li>SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE condition1 OR condition2;</li>
        <li>SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE condition1 AND (condition2 OR condition3);</li>
        <li>SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE EXISTS (SELECT column_name FROM table_name WHERE condition);</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Corresponding application code:</strong></p>
        <pre><code class="language-python">user_id = input("Enter user ID: ")
query = "SELECT username, password FROM users WHERE id = '" + user_id + "'"
cursor.execute(query)</code></pre>
        <blockquote>The injection occurs within the WHERE clause, due to unsanitized input concatenated directly into the SQL query.</blockquote>
        <li>The vulnerability is coming from the python application code and is executed afterwards in the SQL env.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_Query_Language" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Structured Query Language</a> fait partie de la m√™me famille que les langages ALPHA (dont il est le descendant), SQUARE, QUEL (int√©gr√© √† Ingres) ou QBE (Zloof). Il a √©t√© appel√© SEQUEL √† sa naissance, mais ce nom a √©t√© chang√© en SQL parce que SEQUEL √©tait une marque d√©pos√©e de l'avionneur Hawker-Siddeley.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>üíâ SQL Injection</h3>
  <h4>Detection</h4>
  To detect the vulnerability, one has to trigger and check for error messages coming from the SQL server.
  To do so, an ethical hacker can inject a single quote (apostrophe) to indirectly check whether the code application is correctly written.
  <h4>Exploitation</h4>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SQL injection</a> (SQLi) is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to interfere with the queries that an application makes to its database. This can allow an attacker to view data that they are not normally able to retrieve. This might include data that belongs to other users, or any other data that the application can access. In many cases, an attacker can modify or delete this data, causing persistent changes to the application's content or behavior.</li>
    <li>I practiced and understood key concepts of SQL Injection by challenging PortSwigger labs.</li>
    <li>To exploit such a vulnerability, one needs to inject an apostrophe in the user input field.</li>
    <li>The apostrophe will close the query input field, here's an example:
      <ul>
        <li>Here's the application code : <br />
            query = "SELECT username, password FROM users WHERE id = '" + user_id + "'"
        </li>
        <li>When an expected user input (such as 42) is submitted, the query becomes :<br />
            query = "SELECT username, password FROM users WHERE id = '42'"
        </li>
        <li>When a malicious input (such as <strong>42'; DROP TABLE users; --</strong>) is used, the query becomes: <br />
            query = "SELECT username, password FROM users WHERE id = '42'; DROP TABLE users; --'"<br />
            This changes the one query into two queries :<br />
              - The first remains the same ;<br />
              - The second is malicious as it <strong>deletes the entire users table.</strong><br />
            The ending -- will tell the database to ignore what comes after.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
