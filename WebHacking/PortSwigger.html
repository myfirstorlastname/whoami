  <h2>üß† About</h2>
  <p>I'm a pseudonymous cybersecurity professional with expertise in offensive security, SOC analysis, and secure system design.<br />
     BSCP (Burp Suite Certified Practitioner) is a hands-on certification by PortSwigger that validates expertise in web application security and offensive testing using Burp Suite.</br>
     This page outlines my self-driven journey toward becoming a Burp Suite Certified Practitioner (BSCP). It showcases the progression of my web-offensive technical skills‚Äîfrom basic knowledge to OWASP mastery. This page is designed for recruiters and cybersecurity professionals who want a clear picture of my dedication and capabilities.<br />
  </p>

  <h2>üõ∞Ô∏è Philosophy</h2>
  <blockquote>"Slow and steady wins the prize."</blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>I believe web-offensive security is not about being the smartest person in the room‚Äîit‚Äôs about practice, deep comprehension of infrastructures, and method. I treat working as a web bug bounty hunter as a craft: recon, exploit, report, repeat. My learning philosophy includes:
      <ul>
        <li>Try ‚Üí Fail ‚Üí Learn: I embrace discomfort as a sign of growth.</li>
        <li>Consistency over bursts: A few focused hours every day beats weekend marathons.</li>
        <li>Depth over tools: I master concepts, not just tools.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <blockquote>From basic knowledge to OWASP mastery</blockquote>
  <h3>üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started: What is OWASP top 10 ?</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>I began my journey into offensive cybersecurity with a fundamental question: How can I transition into a professional offensive security role?
      <ul>
        <li>I had almost no prior experience in offensive security.</li>
        <li>At this point, I didn't know the different roles that coexist in offensive security, nor did I have a real understanding of their missions.</li>
        <li>I decided to actively apply to any junior offensive roles.</li>
        <li>At that point, without a primary professional engagement, I decided to actively develop my skills and deepen my knowledge in cybersecurity: I started doing CTFs on RootMe.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OWASP Top 10</a> is a standard awareness document for developers and web application security. It represents a broad consensus about the most critical security risks to web applications.</li>

  <h3>üïµ Professional activity: Bug Bounty Hunter</h3>
  <h4>üí• <a href="https://www.hackerone.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HackerOne</a></h4>
  <ul>
    <li>While upgrading my skills, I still had no professional cybersecurity role. I thus became a bug bounty hunter on HackerOne.
      <ul>
        <li>I had no prior real-world experience in webhacking.</li>
        <li>I gathered intel on: what is a scope, a bug bounty program, a report.</li>
        <li>I challenged my first bug, and this mission lasted one month. It was a medium-sized website with basic functionalities, and the program was open to all.</li>
        <li>I chose this program because it was recently opened and was likely to have some vulnerabilities.</li>
        <li>However, recent programs never reward hunters even if the hunter submit a report containing an exploitable critical vulnerability on a key asset.</li>
        <li>This initial mission allowed me to apply my technical skills in a real-world context, resulting in the submission of several valid reports.</li>
        <li>After this I tried old programs with rewards, but I found in one year of work less than 5 valid exploitables vulns on such programs.</li>
        <li>The reason being that these older programs are already 99% secure in this process:
          <ul>
            <li>The entreprise validates the security of their website through a private team of pentesters.</li>
            <li>They open a bug bounty program to the 10 best bug bounty hunters, that will clear any remaining vulnerability.</li>
            <li>Eventually, a public program is created where I, and all bug bounty hunters in the world can search vulnerabilities.</li>
            <li>One may wonder why such programs are made public if they are already considered secure.</li>
            <li>The rationale is that websites change with every update, and new zero-day vulnerabilities emerge frequently. This is the company's view of the bug bounty hunter's role.</li>
            <li>As a result, only the top-ranked hunters typically earn a sustainable income through this activity.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Ultimately, all of the valid reports I submitted on older programs were marked as duplicates.</li>
        <li>Duplicate reports are generally not rewarded, as recognition is typically granted on a first-come, first-served basis.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Despite all the above downsides of this activity, I learnt more in this year than I could in professional roles:
      <ul>
        <li>How to approach the recon phase.</li>
        <li>How to gather specific intel from resources on the internet: resembling open-source intelligence (OSINT) methodologies</li>
        <li>Where to expect vulnerabilities: Profile page, custom error page</li>
        <li>How to exploit the vulnerability, and to quickly assess whether an exploit path is viable or not.</li>
        <li>How to chain attacks to further exploit different minor vulnerabilities: IDOR+XSS</li>
        <li>How to write a custom report: Good practices, Reproducible exploit (screenshots), Mitigations and Recommendations</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
