    <h2>üß† About</h2>
    <p>This page outlines my self-driven journey toward becoming a Burp Suite Certified Practitioner (BSCP). It showcases my progression from beginner-level hacking to OWASP mastery. This learning path is based on hands-on training, CTFs, and real-world challenges.</p>

    <blockquote>"I prefer stealth over spectacle."</blockquote>
    <ul>
      <li>I embrace discomfort as a sign of growth.</li>
      <li>Consistency over bursts: daily focused hours beat weekend marathons.</li>
      <li>I master concepts, not just tools or writeups.</li>

  <h2>üï∏Ô∏è Overview</h2>
  <p>
    The Application & Web domain focuses on securing and assessing the software layer of modern systems‚Äîespecially web applications, APIs, and client-side logic. Web security is a dynamic field, as it often represents the most exposed attack surface.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Defensive Perspective:</strong> Effective protection involves secure software development practices (SDLC), thorough code review, and the use of automated tools such as SAST, DAST, and WAFs. Authentication hardening, proper session management, and input validation are pillars of a secure application.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Red Team Perspective:</strong> Web penetration testing focuses on identifying vulnerabilities such as injection flaws, access control issues, and logic bugs. Knowledge of the OWASP Top 10 is fundamental. In bug bounty and offensive testing, chaining subtle issues (e.g. CSP bypass + token leak) often leads to impactful findings.
  </p>
  <p>
    Mastery in this area means understanding both the browser's behavior and backend infrastructure, to defend or to exploit accordingly.
